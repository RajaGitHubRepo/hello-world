By calling a funciton on submission on the form..
and processing the form action in that function. 

But with the angular, we have another means of processiong a form, by means of Observalble chain. 
which we then can subscribe to.
By using Reactive forms and Rxjs Operators we can implement powerful functionality with a few lines of code.
Reactive forms is better when we need realtime processing of the form 

and treditional model driven forms whth submit and process the form action -> 
this is useful when there is a distinct action applied when user pressses a button.
