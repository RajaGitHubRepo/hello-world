The javascript primitive types (Numbers, Strins, Booleans) are Immutable: 
meaning they can't change, once the value is assigned.

but arrays, objects are  mutables: 

Angular has two types of change detection strategies:
-----------------------------------------------------
1. OnPush : Means theat the changeDetectors mode to check once.
2. Default : Change detection mode to check always

What happenns when we use default change detection strategy:
Changes are triggered by events and propagation of changes are done in two phases:
1. Application phase (In this Phase, the application is responsible for updating the model)
2. Change detection phase.

ngOnInit()
ngOnChanges() : Every time, When there is a chnage in input property the component. 
ngDoCheck() : It is invoked when the chagne detector of given comoponent is invoked , it allows us implement our own change detection
algorthim for our component, here we can track if there is a change.
