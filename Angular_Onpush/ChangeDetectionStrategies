##OnPushChangeDetection

Onpush Change detection is faster than nomral Change detection.
but also it is trickier to use and understand.

Angular default change detection compares the previous value to the current value.
if it detects, angular will update the view. 

When Using OnPush Change detection strategy:
When some trigger happend in the parent copmnet and directly mutating the model 
(View Syncronisation) will not happen.

you have change the opbject 
// Big difference is we are not mutating the object directly, but we are creating a new copy and assigning the 
copy.

On the Parent Component @Input() property is Changed...when we changed we are giving completly new object 
from the parent to the child via @input() property, so the view will update accordingly.

onEdit()
{
  this.courses[0].description = "new value"; // Click of a Button directly changing the Object. 
  // create a copy 
  const course = this.courses[0];            // Step 1: create a referece to the object we want to modify
  const newCourse: any = {...course};        // step 2: object spread typescript notation.
  newCourse.description = "new value";       // step 3: mutate the copy we just created. 
  this.course[0] = newCourse;                // step 4: Assign the new copy we created
}
