Loading strategies for our lazy loaded modules : 
------------------------------------------------
This really does make differnce in performace of our application.
not the size of the downloads but the percieved performace.

If your application has a lazy loaded module (the route path is a lazy loaded path)
we can tell angular how to load that module. The default way is to load the module 
on demand.

suppose if you have a usermodule ...when you click on login button, then only this
module is getting loaded.  -> this is called loading on demand.

now lets change the loading strategy to pre fetch as soon as possible. 

PreLoadingStratergy : PreloadAllModules -> you can customise the preloading 
strategy, so you can optimise the loading strategies. 
Suppose if you have modules of larger size, pre fetching will improve the 
percieved performace of angular applications.
