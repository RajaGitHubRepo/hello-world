We can configure angular project by adding extension (TSLint) is a typescript linting.
Linting defines set of rules for consistency of code for your team. 
like 
 1. Alwasy use semicolon at the end of statements
 2. Enforce const if you are not modifying the variables
 3. enforcing curly braces even for single line, enforce spacing etc.. 
 All those rules, we can configure (tslint.json), if the angular code did not fix these errors the build is not succesufull.
 
 Some linting errrors are auto fixable. 
 
 
 
 how to run ts lint from command line : 
 --------------------
 
 ng Lint  --> to give you linting errors.
 ng lint --fix --> to fix the automatic linting errors.
