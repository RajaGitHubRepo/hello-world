Understanding functions as values topic is very important
it is very connected to closure I guess.. 

1. Assign funcitons to a values (functions as regular values)
2. Passing functions as a paramters to methods
3. Returning functions from methodds
4. Functions which creates another functions.
5. Funcitons which changes other functions.
6. Functions that provide new control flow.
