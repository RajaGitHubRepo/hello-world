There are many ways to define a function in javascript
there is a modern way to define a function with out using the keyword function..

const x = funciton ()
{ 
  // "this" is the caller of x
};

const y = () => {
// this is not the caller of Y

// It's the same "this" found in Y's scope
};

This arrow syntax is most preferrable, becasue it is shorter..
but also it behaves more predictably with closures....

an arrow function does not care who calls it
but a regular funciton will care verymuch who calls it..
