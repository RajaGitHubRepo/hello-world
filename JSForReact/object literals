Objects are very popular and widly used in communicating with other parts of the code.
these modern features will allow easily communicate. using these features will allow to 
read and write code bit shorter and easier to read. 

instead of using new object  you can create object with object literal syntax. 
literal intiation we can use it for arrays, strings, objects , numbers 

Modern javascript supports Dynamic property literal ,
                           -------------------------
what this means javascript will evaluate 
[age] = 70,; // it looks like array literal but do not consfuse with this 
The javascript will evaluate at run time 
assuming variable name (var age = 'myage')

Here is javascript interview question 
what is the values of console.log (obj.age); == > Undefined because javascript evaluate 
the name of the property 
so obj.myage  is the valid property and it prints the value 70

Other widly popular feature of object literals is 
when you need to define an objet with a property name to a value that exists in current scope
                                 ------------------------------------------------------------- 
with the exact same name. 
------------------------
if we have a variable name inverseofpie,
if you want to have a same property name as inverseofpie holdig the same value then
we can define like this 
in stead of writing the property name twice, we can use shorter syntax to achieve the same results'
