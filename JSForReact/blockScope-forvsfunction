ES6-ES2015 - every year new release is being released with year name at the end.
This is not commplete coverage of Modern javascript

{{{}}} => what is this ? this is nested block scope...
block is a created with pair of curly braces...

this also used for If statements and for statements  and functions
block scopes are bit different for function scopes:
---------------------------------------------------
lets understand it by comparing using block scope with For loop and function 

function sum (a, b)
{
var result;
result = a + b ; 

}

if you try to print result ==> you can not print here....

You can not access the var (result ) out side of the function sum...... 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
for (var i=2 ; i<=10; i++)
{
}
i  => if you print it will give you the value 11 ==> that means you can access it. this is bit not intended, so in modern javascript
the normal way to avoid this is using let keyword.....

for (let i=2 ; i<=10; i++)
{
}
i = > you will get the error i is not defined. -- This is good and the needed behaviour.
