You can define strings in javascirpt with single quote (or) double quote 
We have new syntax start with to define strings starts and ends with backtick (`)
they support interpolation, that means we can inject any js expression with $ sign 
and {} (${interpolation})curly braces ...the resulting string is contains the value of expression 
exactly where it was injected in the string.
you dont need to use spl charector for end of the line. You can 
get the real multiline string with out extra code.
