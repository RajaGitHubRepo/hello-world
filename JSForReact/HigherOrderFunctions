Higher order function is a function that can take function as parameter and returns function as return value.
1. Functions are first class citigens (meaning their type is object)--since functions are simply objects, 
they can be returned the same as any other value 
2.They can be assigned as a value of a variable
3.They can be passed and returned just like any other reference variable.
