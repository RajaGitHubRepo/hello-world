Today I found this website which explains all about JavaScript. 
This online tutorial logically divided the javascript in to multiple moudles.
Part1 : core javascript functionality (like variables, syntax, language concepts)
Part2 : Browser: Document, Events, Interfaces.

I found it is a good resource to learn Javascript.

Relationship between: JS versions, ECMA standards and browsers. 
Which javascript version is supporing which standard.
and what browsers are implemented ECMA standards. 
Like IE11 only supports ES5 ..

What are the enhancements from Es5 to Es10..
Good Article on javascript versioning. (https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_versions.asp)

while learning react you need to have basic understanding of Javascript:
The basics atleast you should know to get along are:
1. Js variables and types.
2. Objects and Arrays.
3. Functions and classes.
4. Loops and conditionals.

Good resources for labs :

react, but javascript syntax errors above link is a good resource ). You must go through it and have a reference
