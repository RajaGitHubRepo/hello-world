Today I found this website which explains all about JavaScript. 
This online tutorial logically divided the javascript in to multiple moudles.
Part1 : core javascript functionality (like variables, syntax, language concepts)
Part2 : Browser: Document, Events, Interfaces.

I found it is a good resource to learn Javascript.
