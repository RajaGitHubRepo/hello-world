Bootstrap has some .js files, 
to use some of the components from bootstrap, you need to use Jquery.

ng-bootstarp => you dont have to use jquery, you can just use them 
as angular components.(In that way you can avoid using jQuery) 

Angualr Material => the look and feel is like Google apps ( dialogs and all are
looks like they just looks like in Google apps)
