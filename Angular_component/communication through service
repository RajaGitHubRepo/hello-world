We can use service as a storing machanism to store data or state
there it can communicate that state to other components.

What is state means ? 

Several techniques to manage and store state :
 there are many machanism to track the state: 
   1. Property bag - They are just bags of properties 
   2. Angulars built in change detection
   3. statemanagment with notifications - like subject, behaviour subject (subjects are way to provide notifications when
   we can not leverage the angulars built in change detection) to communicate state changes.
   4. NgRx/Redux -> powerful state management library (Ngrx provides well defined pattern and techniques for 
   handling complex stete through out an application.But it requires lot of configuration and coding for maintenence. 
   

Property bag service : 
    component communicates to it self
    component communicates to other componenet 

Service scope and lifetime :
