Services are not only great for sharing data. They can also provide notifications. 

In this section, we will learn how to communicate through service by broadcasting 
changes throguh service. 

A service can broad cast notification, like user is looged out (or) a new prodcut is added. 
Instead of a component asks for a new state. The service can broadcast a notification. 

so this does not needto be a state management service, we can add this notification machanism 
to any service. 

Broad casting service notifications:
