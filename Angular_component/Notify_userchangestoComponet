Three ways to notify user changes to component:

1. Two way data binding.
2. Getters and setters.
3. ValueChanges Observables.
----------------------------
Angular provides two types for building forms : 
1. Template Driven : We need @viewChild to communicate with template elements. 

2. Reactive Forms : we build forms using Forms and groups, controls so no need of @viewChild here to communicate 

In both the above cases ( template driven (or) reactive forms )  provides the valueChanges Observables (is a stream of events)
we subscribe to observables to start recieving the events. each time a even is emited funciton defined in the 
subscribe method is executed.
