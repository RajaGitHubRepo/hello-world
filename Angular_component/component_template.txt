 Communication between Template and Component...
 ------------------------------------------------
 Binidng. 
 getters and setters and
 
 view child decorator : what is it ? 
 We use view child and view children (to obtain reference to multiple elements) to communicate with its template (Native element or elements). By getting the native element reference , you can access the native html element properties (like name, type, value etc... ) or call its methods
 such as focus, blur, or select etc... methods 
 viewChild has an issue with ngIf -> what is that issue? and how to resolve it. 
 
 
 How to get a hold of an element in a template and work with it directly..
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 @viewchild to get hold of native html element, and by this native html element we can 
 accees the properites and methods of native html element.
 
 
 How parent and child communicates each other : 
 -----------------------------------------------
 Parent can push data to the child component, and also parent component can pull data from the child.
 If you design a search or fileter box as child component, we can use this child 
 component in many parent components for filtering options. 
 
 Configuration parameter parent can setup.
 Parent coponent may provide default value, that want to pass to child component. like last enterd filter criteria.
 In the case where parent componet managers the list of items and the clild component displays one of those items, 
 parent component can pass the items data to the clild.
 Parent component can also want the child to perform 
 the action ( for example chile may have clear or reset method the parent want to call).
 /////////////////////
 @input
 Getters and setters
 OnChanges Life cycle hooks
 ///////////////// 
 @input - decorator ( this allows the parent to pass the data to child component) 
 if the child componnet needs to moniter the changes from that data from the parent component 
 the clinet component can set up getters and setters 
 or handle the OnChanges life cycle hooks
 _______________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 Parent can also request the information from the clild.
 for example parent want to have one of hte property of a child component
 for filter by example the parent want to have .  
 to do above , It first needs the reference to child component by using template referece.
 The parent component gets that reference component using template referece variable 
 and @ViewChild decorator : We can also use services as comminication medium to communicate 
 between parent and child.
