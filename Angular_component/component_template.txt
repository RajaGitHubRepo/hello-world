 Notify the component of user changes :
 --------------------------------------
  1. Two way bindiing - long way
  2. Getter and setter (in the component class)
  3. valueChanges Objervables (this is available with Angular forms directive) Even the input element is not on a form,
  like in our example filter by is not on a form. (Befor going to understand this, we need to understand the viewChild and 
  viewChildren directives)
 
 Two way binding is combination of property binding and evenbinding.
 
 Like c# and java:
 Typescript provides two ways to define a property.
 1. Most common technique is decalre name of the property : and its type
 2. The other way is two functions getter and setter 
 
 Guidelines communicating whth Template: 
 ---------------------------------------
 
 How parent and child communicates each other : 
 -----------------------------------------------
 Parent can push data to the child component, and also parent component can pull data from the child.
 If you design a search or fileter box as child component, we can use this child 
 component in many parent components for filtering options. 
 
 Configuration parameter parent can setup.
 Parent coponent may provide default value, that want to pass to child component. like last enterd filter criteria.
 In the case where parent componet managers the list of items and the clild component displays one of those items, 
 parent component can pass the items data to the clild.
 Parent component can also want the child to perform 
 the action ( for example chile may have clear or reset method the parent want to call).
 /////////////////////
 @input
 Getters and setters
 OnChanges Life cycle hooks  -> Getters and setters and OnChanges life cycle hooks to monitor the changes happend 
 on the parent and update accordingly on the child component....
 ///////////////// 
 @input - decorator ( this allows the parent to pass the data to child component) 
 if the child componnet needs to moniter the changes from that data from the parent component 
 the clinet component can set up getters and setters 
 or handle the OnChanges life cycle hooks
 _______________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 Parent can also request the information from the clild.
 for example parent want to have one of hte property of a child component
 for filter by example the parent want to have .  
 to do above , It first needs the reference to child component by using template referece.
 The parent component gets that reference component using template referece variable 
 and @ViewChild decorator : We can also use services as comminication medium to communicate 
 between parent and child.
