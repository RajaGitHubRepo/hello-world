Reactive Programming:
--------------------
Stream -> sequence of values of over time 
example : 
1.Mouse moving on the screen -> x, y cooridantes of each move 
2.when you are entering a form -> each key press sending  in a jsom format is a stream 
[
{"name" = "R"}
{"name" = "RA"}
{"name" = "RAJ"}
{"name" = "RAJA"}
]
3. Web socket data retrun from a real time web socket from a connection.
4. chat window openedby user in a browser.

So everything we do in web programing can be  thouht as a stream. 

Reactive programming = streams + Operations -==> Is the idea is that you can create your entair program just by defining the
different streams and different operations perfromed on that stream.

Theorytically it is easy to say...but how can we tune our mind to program reactvily. 
you define strems and oprerations -> and the rest will be taken care by framework.
in reactive programing we don't define funcitons, we just define how our application is plumbed  together.
streams are sequence of values over time.
