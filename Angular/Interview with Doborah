The Angular pattern is very consistent, you can pickup the code
and start looking, you know where is the first file to look at
and what is the next file to look at and so on...
Seperation of template (View) and code behind.

You can use rxjs really well in to Angualar... you can build reactive apps.

Amazing community: Amazing peple, kind, welcoming, easy to talk to.

React and view are competeriors to Angular : 

She likes to compares it like a restarent, some people like to go and sit down have a meal it gives
everything, it got the right potatos, protine, vegitable compleents  portions, vegetables with right components, all
comes with one unit.

Pick and choose your own protine,vegitables, salads..

When using Angular you get everting, You get your router package, you get http pacakge, 
You get a prescribed way to code with Angular
 
React is like pick and choose, you choose your own http pakcage, your own rotuer package...etc.. it depends on your preference, 
If you hire angular developer, you know that he might have worked in all the pakcages and same. 

react developer might not worked on the same package for http package in their previous job. 
In the end they (Angular/React/Vue..etc) all meet the same goal (and all satisfy our develpment hunger).
