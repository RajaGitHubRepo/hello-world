Observables : cany be any thing 
finate or infinate time : like http requst once reaponse is retrun it is finate 
events from elements - its infiniate

Observers : any object whihc implements simple interaface ( next (), error(), complete() ) 
3 types of messages an observable can produce.

next() -> they push the next value in the data stream to the observers 
errror() -> If they encountered the error, they call the error method..
complete() -> When observables done prodcuing values, they call complete.  

Subscripbers is a specific type in rxjs it also observer since it implements 
the observer interface (next, error, complete)

you can use Observables in 3 ways:
----------------------------------
1. Create from scrach 
2. covert from array or some tyeps
3. return from api end points 

contorl + shift + space ==> to have visula studio code to show the number of paramters for contsturctor
