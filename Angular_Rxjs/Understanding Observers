Here we are going to discuss : 
-------------------------------
Observers implement observers Interface (Implement3  methods next, error, complete)

1.How to create Observers and how to use observers to consume the observable. 
2.How to consume the values produced by those observables.
3.How to consume not just values (but also erros and completion messages)
4.What exactly it means to subscribe to an observable ? 
5.what happens when multiple observers subscribe (or Observing) to same Observable ? ==> 
   Suppose you create a observable to get the current time.
   and create 3 observers to the above Observable at 1 sec delay/
   When you console the values of tiems -> they each print at 3 different intervals.
6.what is subscription object ? and how it is usful for cancelling the subscription of observables.
