Subjects are Observales:
-------------------------
They Implemented as a child class of the Observable class
This means they have subscribe method that can be pass as an objesrver just like any other Obsrvalble.

They are also Observers :
-------------------------
All subjects have method names 'next, error, complete' which menas they can 
also acts as Observers and can subscribe to Observables: 

Beeing Subjects are both Observable and Observers, this posses some interesting capabilities...

Since Subject is a objeservale ( productes values) , 
subject created Proxys of vlaues and also maintains state and maintains list of Observers..
because they maintain the list of observers, subjects can push values to more than one 
Observer at a time. 
This makes them Multicast instead of UniCast...
