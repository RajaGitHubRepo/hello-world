Observables : cany be any thing 
finate or infinate time : like http requst once reaponse is retrun it is finate 
events from elements - its infiniate

Observers : any object whihc implements simple interaface ( next (), error(), complete() ) 
3 types of messages an observable can produce.

next() -> they push the next value in the data stream to the observers 
errror() -> If they encountered the error, they call the error method..
complete() -> When observables done prodcuing values, they call complete.  

Subscripbers is a specific type in rxjs it also observer since it implements 
the observer interface (next, error, complete)

you can use Observables in 3 ways:
----------------------------------
1. Create from scrach 
2. covert from array or some tyeps
3. return from api end points 

contorl + shift + space ==> to have visula studio code to show the number of paramters for contsturctor 

Convert from array or some types:
---------------------------------
of, from , fromEvent --> are some operators from 'rxjs'. of() => has 10 overloads so it is very flexible.
Of () is a very flexible , it can take any type with comma ',' Seperated list of values. 

From funciton: From is similar to of ( but From takes encapsulated object of values) of can take
many individual values as input paramters.


let source1$ = of("string", 10, "numbr", 1) ; 
source1$.subscribe(value => console.log(value));

let source2$ = from (booksArray);
source2$.subscribe(book => Console.log(book.title));

How to create a observables from more than two observables :
Use Concat Function:
---------------------
let source3$ = concat(source1$, source2$) ;
source3$.subscribe(value => Cosole.log(value));
