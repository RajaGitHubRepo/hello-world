Web is not the fixed width:

Responsive Web Design: 3 core concepts/ foundations (all are happeing in css)
1. A Fluid Foundation  ( Idea of moving away from pixels/fixing widths in our layouts to more propotiante thinking ) 
   - use percentage based grids (always calculate percentages)

2. Flexible content ( once the lay out is flexible, the content we put in these layout also has to adjust ) 
   - max-width
   - width 

3. Media Queries ( when the layout and content don't work well, then we use media queries )
