HTTP Resources:
----------------
Any things jpg file or pdf file any thing html contect is condisderd as HTTP Resource. Typically a HTML page contains many 
resources like dispaly of images, Videos, audio files, css styelshhets etc... all are considered as HTTP resouces.

http://HOst:portNumber/?key=value#Fragment 

first part is : U.R.L Scheme 
Second part : Host (DNS Server will find the I.P address) 
Third Part : Port number (defalut post Host alwasy listen is 80). For debug and additional purpsoes it uses 8080, in that case 
Third part should be displayed. Usually most websites dont include this part as it is difficult for user to remember URL. 

Fouth Part : Query String : It contains Key Value pair 
Fifth Part : Fragment : This only applicable at client side, With in the page it opens perticular section for the client.

HTTP Messages: 
---------------- 
Two types of Messages : 1. HTTPRequest (client sends the requset to Server - While sending it it should send 
the message in such a way that Server should Understand the message sent by a client)  2. HTTP Response (Server sents the return mess
age to the client).

According to HTTP 1.1 specification, both request and response are two different types of messages, and they get exchanged in single
Http transaction. 

What is single http transaction ? 

Telnet is a software where you can connect to server and request a resource.  While using telent sample request operation 
GET /Xyz.Jpg HTTP /1.1 ---Get is a primary HTTP method 
HOST www.xyz.com  --- Host is server which we are trying to connect to.. 

Available HTTP methods are: GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, HEAD etc... 
What is the primary difference between GET And POST method ? Get is a safe method , becasue it will not alter or update any thing in 
server/Host, they just request a resource from Host, so It is safe method. 

 But Post will alter or updates in Servers like submit an order, sumbit credit cord processing etc... Since POST is a Unsafe method
 web servers perform the requests differently.
