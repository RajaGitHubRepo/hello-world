Ajax is the art of exchanging data with the server.And update parts of the page with out reloading the whole page.

some of the Jquery Ajax methods are listed here: 
1. $.Ajax() : performs async requests.
2. $.AjaxSetup() : Sets the default values for future Ajax requests
3. $.Get() : Loads the data from server using Ajax HTTP Get
4. $.GetJson() : Loads Json Encoded data from Server using HTTP Get Reqeust
5. $.Load() : Loads data from server and puts the returned data in to selected element
6. $.Post(): Loads the data from server using Ajax HTTP post 

Some examples: 

1. How to declare Jquery Ajax in html  
Ans : one has to include bleow tag in your html page.
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.12.0/jquery.min.js"></script> from the website and download http://jquery.com/download/

(or) you can download from the website and download (http://jquery.com/download/) and include like below
<script src="jquery.js"></script>

2. significance of $(document).ready(function() function 

Ans : While JavaScript provides the load event for executing code when a page is rendered, this event does not get triggered 
until all assets such as images have been completely received. In most cases, the script can be run as soon as the DOM 
hierarchy has been fully constructed. The handler passed to .ready() is guaranteed to be executed after the DOM is ready, 
so this is usually the best place to attach all other event handlers and run other jQuery code. When using scripts that 
rely on the value of CSS style properties, it's important to reference external stylesheets or embed style elements before 
referencing the scripts.

In cases where code relies on loaded assets (for example, if the dimensions of an image are required),
the code should be placed in a handler for the load event instead.The .ready() method is generally incompatible 
with the <body onload=""> attribute. If load must be used, either do not use .ready() or use jQuery's .load() method to 
attach load event handlers to the window or to more specific items, like images.
